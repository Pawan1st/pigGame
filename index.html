    <h1>Instructions</h1>
    <p>1. On your turn, roll a standard six-sided die.</p>
    <p>2. If you roll a 1, your turn immediately ends, and you score no points for that turn. Pass the die to the next player.</p>
    <p>3. If you roll a number from 2 to 6, add that number to your current turn total. Now, you have a choice:
      <ul>
        <li>You can choose to "Hold" and lock in your current turn's points by pressing the "ðŸ“¥ Hold" button. This means your turn ends, and the points you've accumulated during this turn are added to your total score.</li>
        <li>Alternatively, you may continue rolling by pressing the "ðŸŽ² Roll dice" button. If you roll a 1 at any point, you lose all the points accumulated in your current turn. You can continue rolling until you decide to "Hold" or roll a 1.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>4. When you decide to "ðŸ“¥ Hold" or if you roll a 1, your turn ends, and you pass the die to the next player. Be sure to record your turn's total points on the scorecard if you choose to "Hold."</p>
    <p>5. Repeat these steps as play continues clockwise around the table.</p>
